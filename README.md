My expence-tracker is in master branch.
This application that allows users to securely register, log in, and manage their daily expenses. Users can add  and delete expenses with details like date, category, amount, and notes. The dashboard also includes a track of  total spend. i  built this project to practice real-world CRUD operations, user authentication using JWT, and responsive UI design with basic CSS and Tailwind. I used AI tools (ChatGPT) at a few key pointsâ€”such as generating initial backend structure, fixing common Git errors, and getting quick help with React component logic and layout ideas. This helped speed up development and gave me clarity while learning.
 And To run this Expense Tracker application on your local machine, make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed. First, clone the repository and navigate into it. The app has two main parts: the backend server (Node.js + Express) and the frontend client (React). Inside the server folder, install dependencies using npm install, then create a .env file with your MongoDB connection string, JWT secret, and port. Start the server using npm run dev. Then, move to the client folder, run npm install, and launch the React app using npm start. Your application should now be live locally at http://localhost:3000, connected to your MongoDB database and backend APIs.
